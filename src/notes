Exception Handling
	never stop program from running
	if (when) error occurs make error handling 
		to account for it
	Null point is most common exception
		use try and catch for NullPointerException.npe	

	you want everything in java to be an object
		very rarely will we work with primitive data types
	
	java does not handle multiple inheritence
		interface is a work around
			does not have constructor
				only reason why abstract classes are not obsolete
		instance is not a class
	java in 1.8 added default methods
	java in 1.8 also added static method
		dont need to define,
		if you want to use it, 
			you call it at interface class level
		major update, most popular version in years
